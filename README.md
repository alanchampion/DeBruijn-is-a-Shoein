# DeBruijn is a shoe in
CUDA implementation of DeBruijn Graph creation and Euler Cycle finding. 

This is our final project for the High Performance Computing class at Colorado School of Mines. This project's goal is to create a fast implementation of DeBruijn Graph creation and Euler Cycle finding. 

The naive implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ksteinma/HPC-Final-Project). 

## Getting Started

Run make from the main folder to create the executable. 

Input is fastq files. 

### Prerequisites

make and nvcc.
